Scratch

* Not all computer languages are based on text -for example, Scratch (thanks MIT!)
* "hello world!" is the one of the most common introductions to computer sciencem almost everyone gets started in any new language by running some version of "hello, world!"
* Sprites are entities or characters that are displayed on a computer screen by some program, ofter a game, that allows the use to interact with the computer visually
* COmputers are not particualrly smart on their own - they will only do exactly what you tell them to do
* if we put only "When Green Flag Clicked", the computer won't do anything, even if we click the green flag
* if we want to have the computer to do anything else, we'll need to include that after out "When Green Flag Clicked"
