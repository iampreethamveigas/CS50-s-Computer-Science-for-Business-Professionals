Abastraction

* We don't need to see whats going on uner the hood in order for things to work -we can use computers without being computer scientists
* We think of concept of a shape (circlem square, trianlge) abstractly
* Computer are not intelligent - they only do what we ask of them! (seem suprising!)
* So we cannot tell the computer something in the abstact and have it actually follow what is going on
* However, with more precision in our instruction, we can tell our computer exactly what we want
* We must implement our abstract ideas in the computer in order for it to follow what we are doing, which we can think of as a programming
* this could be very tedious, weiting down a complete list of every step each time we wanted something to work
* Luckily, we can record these steps, and have them work the same way every time - in things like libraries - so that other programmers can use what we made
* in this way, we abstract out the steps involved, so that when someone tell the computer to, for example, draw a circle, it knows exactly what we mean
