Conditions

* Maybe we don't want Scratch to walk into a wall and get stuck there every time we run our program
* boolean expressions are statements that only have 2 possible answers -True/False, Yes/No, 1/0
* We can use these boolean to check for things affecting our code
* if these sound scary don't worry - you use them all the time in everyday language; "if you have the time...", "While yo're at the store...", etc.
* In the above two cases, "have_time" and "atStore" might be two boolean expressions where their only two values are True and False - either you have time (True) or you don't (False); either you're at the store (True) or you're not (False)
