ASCII - Other Representations 

* What if we made so that 65 = "A"; 66="B"; and so on ?
* for example: 72 73 74 = 'Hi!', at least in one representation
* What if we were using these number for colors? then 72 73 73 could be a color, in the form of how much of the following three colors we have:
* what of we were using these numbers for colors? then 72 73 33 couild be a color, in the form of how mych of the follwing three colors we have; Red Green blue, 72 Red, 73 Green, and 33 Blue, which gies us some weird yellow color overal
* The biggest number in decimal we could represnet with one byte = eight bits of binary numbers, is going to be 255. There are 256 combinations of 0's and 1's, and one of those is decimal number 0, so the higest number representable is 255. So what is 11111111 manually ?
* With the help of IOT this is what i got
* 1 * 2^0 = 1
  1 * 2^1 = 2
  1 * 2^2 = 4
  1 * 2^3 = 8
  1 * 2^4 = 16
  1 * 2^5 = 32
  1 * 2^6 = 64
  1 * 2^7 = 128

hence 128  + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255
