What is coding?

* just taking ideas that we use in every day life, and writing them down into special forms known as programmming languages, each of which has its own syntax (like a grammar), vocabulary, and conventions (like the special phrases you use in your own language)
* In many ways coding is just like writing in a normal human language; there are special rules and vocabulary
