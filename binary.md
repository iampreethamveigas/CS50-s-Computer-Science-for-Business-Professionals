**Computational thinking** ****

Binary** **

We’re use tio thinking in decimal; we have `0 fingers afire all

But computer think in binary all 0’s and 1’s

If you’re conformable in decimal you could argue binary I easier;

Only 2 numbers not 10.

Binary goes from smallest to biggest right left i.e 001 is read in the order 1,0,0 which translates to 2^0+0+0 = 1 in decimal.

With only three places or columns in our binary number the biggest number we can have is 111 = . How do we get bigger numbers ?

More digits, or mire memory/hardware, allow us to represent bigger number I.e 4 spaces could be to 1111 = 15

With these 0’s and 1’s and now bigger numbers represented this way how do we represent other things ?

We are use to thinking un decimal; we have e10 fingers after all** **

In decimal system the digits represent multiples of 10, example 999 :-** **

9 * 10^0 + 9 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^2

:- 9 * 1 = 9, 9 * 10 = 90, 9 * 100 = 900

:- 9 + 90 + 900 = 999

Similarly in binary the digits represent as multiplies of 2, example 1,0,0

It start from rightmost to the left :-

:- 0 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^2

:- 0 * 1 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 0**  **+ 1 * 4

:- 0 0 4 ,** **

If you are comfortable in decimal you could argue binary is easier only 2 numbers not 10,

Binary goes from smallest to biggest right to left, I.e 001 is read in the order of 1, 0, 0 which translates to 2^0+0+0 = 1
