Python

* instead of writing in C, which requires that we remember a lot about specifically. how we code, we could write  in something like Python, which is a "higher level language", or allows us to forego a lot of the syntactical specificity of c(no semicolons, brackets etc)
* Pythnon actually doesn't get compiled straight to machine code instead, it needs to be interpreted into byte code
* This byte code is merely another form for codem which is readable sy something like a virtual machine
* Virutal Machines can be thought of as imaginary computers within our own computer that allow us to run code in special cases or evirn
