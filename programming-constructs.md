Programming Constructs

* functions
* loops
* variables
* conditions
* we use the above to tell a computer what to do, similar to how you might need to direct a toddler to do something -very specifically
* for example, the command move might be some form of function, which allows us to tell the computer to do something relatively complex (lift up right legm push right leg forward, put right leg down, shift weight forward, life left leg, etc) in one command -move
* if we wanted to do something many times it is more effective for us to use some form of loop to repeatedly perfomr and action -i.e move while you are still standing, for 10 steps move
* Somethines loops can go on forever, which can be bad or intentional, but in the first case, we would call this a bug, or a mistake in the code
* many loop use something called a condition to continue looping - we do this intuitively. for example in the move example above, i could tell you to move unitl you've hit a wall, or an edgem or a table. Maybe tell you while you_have_not_hit_table, move, which looks much more like code, but still makes sense to us
* variables, like x and u but can be named more helpful things, like counter, isAlivem current_date, and so on
* variables help us keep track of things in code
